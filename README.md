## Overview

This repository contains the Quarto presentation and supporting materials for **Assignment 1** of the STAT40830 course. The analysis explores key **economic**, **social**, and **environmental** indicators across three countries: **Germany (DEU)**, **Ireland (IRL)**, and the **United States (USA)**.

## Indicators Analyzed

- **Life Expectancy at Birth** (years)
- **GDP per Capita** (current US dollars)
- **COâ‚‚ Emissions per Capita** (excluding LULUCF)

## Goals of the Analysis

1. Load and standardize country-level indicator data using `data.table`.
2. Compare the breadth and coverage of indicators across countries and time.
3. Visualize key trends using `ggplot2`.
4. Perform:
   - Indicator frequency analysis
   - Correlation analysis (GDP vs Life Expectancy)
   - Multi-indicator time series comparisons
5. Derive cross-country insights and trade-offs between prosperity, health, and sustainability.
